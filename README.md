# Production Tracker
This program produces products and creates serial numbers for the products. The program also accepts new products once a user enters info about the new product. Employee accounts can be created which involves creating a username and creating a password that is encrypted. The program was an individual project but received help through resources. The program is created because it was school assignment. At the start of this project my I had no knowledge of C++. I plan to make future updates to this program.

## Getting Started
* To run this program, you will need an IDE such CLion by Jetbrains.
* Once an you have your ide create a C++ file.
* Make sure your computer has C++ compiler like Visual Studio
* Next go to Settings->Build,Execution,&,Deployment->ToolChains and use MinGW as for the debugger.
* Ready to run!

## Built With
* IDE: CLION by Jetbrains
* Software used: MinGW and VisualStudio
