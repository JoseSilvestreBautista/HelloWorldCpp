# Production Tracker
This program produces products and creates serial numbers for the products. The program also accepts new products once a user enter info about the new product. Employee accounts can be created which involves username and password encryption. The program was an individual project but recieved help through resources. The program is created because it was school assignment. At the start of this project my I had no knwoldge of c++. I pland to make future updates to this program.
